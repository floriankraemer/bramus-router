## Acknowledgements

`bramus/router` is inspired upon [Klein](https://github.com/chriso/klein.php), [Ham](https://github.com/radiosilence/Ham), and [JREAM/route](https://bitbucket.org/JREAM/route) . Whilst Klein provides lots of features it is not object oriented. Whilst Ham is Object Oriented, it's bad at _separation of concerns_ as it also provides templating within the routing class. Whilst JREAM/route is a good starting point it is limited in what it does (only GET routes for example).
